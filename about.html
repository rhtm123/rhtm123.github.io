<h1 style="font-weight:300;color:#ff0066"> <i>Hi, I’m Rohit Maurya, an Educator, an Entrepreneur, and a Web Developer. </i> </h1> <br /> <br />

<h2> My Story</h2>
<p> I was born and bought up in a small village of Sant Ravidas Nagar Bhadohi District of Uttar Pradesh. I attended one of the premier institutes of India. I learned Python and website development in college. I joined a company as a backend web developer and left the job after a few months. I decided never to join any company in the future.
</p>
<br />

<h4>Why I left the Job?</h4>
<p>I don’t know the purpose of my life but I am entitled to have a successful life.  A joyful and meaningful life is a success for me. A mentally and physically fit body is a success for me. Adding some positive values to other’s life is a meaningful life for me. I can create more joy and meaning in my life by working for myself rather working for someone else. </p>
<br />

<h4>Why did I choose to be an educator?</h4>
<p>I was a Guru from childhood. I always used to teach my fellow students and they liked my teaching style. Education was always a passion for me. I rediscover this passion after I left the job. Education is the perfect field for me as I enjoy teaching and It also adds the positive values to other’s life.
I founded Gurukul.Guru to redefine education in India. I feel motivated when I am working on a challenging problem. Redefining the Indian Education System is indeed very challenging. <a href="https://www.gurukul.guru/quick-tutorial/tut/3/" target="blank"> Why the current education system needs redefinition? </a>
