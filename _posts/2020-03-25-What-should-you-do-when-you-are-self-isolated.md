We are living in a warlike situation due to Coronavirus(SARS-Cov-2), aren&#39;t we?  **Sometimes I just feel, is there any science fiction movie going on surrounding me?**

Covid-19 cases are growing at an exponential rate around the globe. Indian government has been taking necessary precautions to prevent this pandemic. *PM Modi has announced a total lockdown for 21 days.*

We are going to fight this war together till the victory. How are we going to fight? We will stay at home, practice social distancing, wash our hands regularly.  That sounds very simple, but **a bit** hard to do, isn&#39;t it?

We have a lot of time and not much to do. **You** can waste this time or invest this time in those activities that help you to make a better person. Choice is yours **!**

Here, I am going to tell what are the best things to do in this time period until the things become normal as before

### 1) Reconnect with your special ones

We are busy in our jobs and daily **routine** in normal life. We often ignore the most important thing, which is relationships with special ones. Researchers say that people are the happiest who have good relationships with their family and friends. Now, it&#39;s perfect time to reconnect with them. Talk with them, watch with them, prepare food with them. Just spend some quality time with your special ones.

It&#39;s also a perfect time to talk with that person who once was very close to you. **She/he is just a phone call away, just pick the phone &amp; dial the number, there you go exploring the flashback of your life again.**

Rebuild your relationships. It&#39;s one of the best investments you can try.

### 2) Learn New skills

We always want to learn things as we want to grow in our career. But, the problem is we rarely have the time to do it. Now **this is the** time not for excuses, but for learning. It can be coding, cooking, investing, language, video making or any skill.  Just pick your laptop, books and start learning the skills you always wanted to learn. You are just some clicks away from the best resources in this internet era.
It&#39;s time for us to use the internet not for entertainment, but for learning the skills.

I am personally learning Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning. Also, I am involved in learning about investment. **(After reading the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, I&#39;ve started exploring about the financial investment &amp; management)**

*It is not about only learning new skills, but also for the dream work we always wanted to do but due to lack of time we could never do. Don&#39;t you think, this is the high time to go for it &amp; explore? Don&#39;t forget we have still 20 or more days left!*

### 3) Read Books

One common habit all the successful people have that they read a lot of books. I have been reading books for 4-5 months. I surely can tell you from my experience it is the best investment that I have made.

You can start with self-help, fiction, biography, novel and any other genre you like. Just Read.

*For a new reader, it becomes difficult to read for even half an hour and I&#39;m sure, if you are one of them, you may also fall asleep after a few mins of picking the book.*

**I&#39;ve had an experience here to tackle this impediment - just switch to something which makes you have fun for sometime &amp; then again get back to book, what say?**

### 4) Do that thing that you always wanted to do

When you were in high school or college. You wanted to do it, but were not able to do it due to many reasons. It can be learning a musical instrument, singing, arts, or any things. It&#39;s just the perfect time to relive that fantasy. **Let me remind you here again for the social distancing &amp; self quarantine. Make sure, you are following these instructions to do what you had always wanted to do.**



### 5) Reconnect with yourself

When you connect to yourself you are able to create a life that is meaningful, joyful and fulfilling.

Now, We have all the time in the universe. Listen to your heart, understand your thoughts, feel your emotions. Just try to know the real you.

**You&#39;re already doing isolation, pal, it is just that you get into solitude &amp; ponder upon you.**

### 6) And last but not least…

Staying at home for a long period of time may prove difficult, but that&#39;s even more of a reason to rise to the challenge – Just remember to wash your hands at regular intervals. Avoid going out if avoidable, practice physical distancing.

Enjoy your life with yourself and your family. Learn Something new &amp; **be a Better person amid this Corona Crisis.**

**Let&#39;s defeat the SARS-Cov-2 together**

**By the way, being a curious guy, I would like to hear from you if you have any other point to add here in this list or anything you&#39;re already doing in this self quarantine?**

**Would look forward to see your comments here!**

**Be Safe!**
